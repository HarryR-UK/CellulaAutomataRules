# Conways's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automata which simulates the population of life following 4 rules

This program uses C++ and the SFML library for graphics to visually represent these rules. This produces some interesting results!

# Starting the game
- Please note that this program allows for changing the rules that are associated with the game of life
-
- use command line arguments to change the rules of the game
-
- FOLLOW THE ORDER EXACTLY
-
- ./Program -b . . . -s . . .
-
- Replace the '.' with your single digit numbers
-
- if left empty, the program will automatically set the rules to the standard Conway's rules (B3/S23)


# Controls

> **SPACE** is used to start and stop the simulation
>
> **LEFT CLICK** is used to turn cells alive
>
> **RIGHT CLICK** is used to kill cells
>
> **R** will reset the randomised cells when the game is paused
> 
> **C** will clear the cells entirely when the game is paused
>
> **F** will turn changing cycling colors on / off
> 
> **O** will make the alive cells look more pixelated / less pixelated
>
> **SCROLL WHEEL** will zoom in and out
>
> **LEFT ARROW KEY** will cycle left through the colors when cycle color is false
>
> **RIGHT ARROW KEY** will cycle right through the colors when cycle color is false
>
> **UP ARROW KEY** increases the simulation delay
>
> **DOWN ARROW KEY** decreases the simulation delay
>
> **W A S D** will pan around the map
